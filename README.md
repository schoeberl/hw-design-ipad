# Hardware Design on an iPad

This repository is an experiment to do hardware design with cloud based services and having only a tablet, an iPad, as front end. Only at the very last stage we might need a labtop with an FPGA board attached.

Let's see where this journey leads us and what we can learn from it.

## Project Ideas

We could simply do a vending machine as a proof of the concept. But this is probably very booring ;)

At a greek island, some time ago, I sketched Lipsi, a tiny processor, or maybe better programmable state machine. A circuit itended for helper functions. Maybe this is a more interesting target. This project might also include some software tools, e.g., an assembler.


## How to Start?

The start is already done! This text is written in a web based editor on GitHub to edit README.md on the fly. Therefore, a repository at GitHub is the starting point.

## Where to Execute?

Editing some code can be done everywhere, even local on an iPad. However, we need to execute stuff. And compilation and simulation of hardware description is (currently) not supported on the iPad. Therefore, we move to the cloud:
